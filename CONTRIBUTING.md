# Contributing to Strider

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved, whether you're

- [Reporting a bug](#bug-reports)
- Discussing the current state of the code
- [Submitting a fix](#pull-requests)
- Proposing new features

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing patches and features.

## Code of Conduct

We have adopted the [Contributor Covenant (2.0)](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the latest `main` branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; create a [reduced test case](http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/).

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report.

- What steps will reproduce the issue?
- What did you expect to happen?
- What actually happened?
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or things you tried that didn't work)

All these details will help developers to fix any potential bugs.

## Pull requests

We use [Github flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html).

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your [code lints](#follow-code-style-conventions).
6. Issue that pull request!

## Follow code style conventions

- Follow [PEP 8 conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
- [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) is useful.
